# Models

For the remainder of this tutorial we will use the idea of a record system. A user can create, view, edit and delete a record. A record can also contain zero to many files (RecordFiles) which have info on filetype, filesize, etc. They will also be able to publish the record when ready, thus making it visible by all (inc non-logged in users). In addition, the user can nominate other users to be able to collaborate on the record. A reviewer role will review the published record before it is made public.
