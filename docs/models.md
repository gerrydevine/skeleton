For the remainder of this tutorial we will use the idea of a record system. A user can create, view, edit and delete a record. They will also be able to publish the record when ready, thus making it visible by all (inc non-logged in users). In addition, the user can nominate other users to be able to collaborate on the record. A reviewer role will review the published record before it is made public.
